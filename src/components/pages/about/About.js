              I am a dedicated, hardworking and disciplined individual. I have a
              strong religious background which I believe has given good morals
              and ethics â€“ including taking responsibility when required, being
              respectful and showing good manners. I believe that thinking
              positively will ultimately result in a positive outcome.
