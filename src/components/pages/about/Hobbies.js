              Gaining computer and programming knowledge
            </h1>
            <p className="about-me-subtitle line-height">
              My inspiration for coding came from a young age 7+. My Dad would
              bring computers from work and give it to me and my siblings to
              use. I’ve gained knowledge of how to build a computer, how to
              install an operating system, how to troubleshoot problems with the
              operating system and as a hobby I used to make videos, design
              logos and make 3D animations of the logo. Some time in High School
              I did some research on programming and I knew that I wanted to do
              programming as a full-time job. I started learning HTML in Grade
              11 from a website called w3schools.com. I finished their tutorial
              but didn’t manage to finish their quiz because I had to focus on
              Grade 12.

              I love spending time with my family if I managed to have time be
              with them because I believe that communicating with family will
              strengthen our family because they are an important part of my
              life{" "}
